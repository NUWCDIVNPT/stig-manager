Data Model
--------------------

STIG Manager's primary organizational structure is the Collection. A Collection can be created to mirror components of an RMF Package, requirements identified in a Security Assessment Plan, or an entirely different principle that may be more convenient, such as by an organization's Lab or by Asset OS.



Collections are composed of:
  * Assets
  * STIGs attached to those Assets
  * Reviews of the Rules that compose each attached STIG
  * User Grants providing access to some or all of the Assets/STIGs in that Collection
  * Reports providing Status and Findings information
