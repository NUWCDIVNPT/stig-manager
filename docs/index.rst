Welcome to STIG Manager's documentation!
========================================


What is STIG Manager?
-------------------------------
STIG Manager is an Open Source API and Web client for managing the assessment of Information Systems for compliance with `security checklists <https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/>`_ published by the United States (U.S.) Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). STIG Manager supports DISA checklists `distributed <https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/>`_ as either a Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) or a Security Requirements Guide (SRG) in the XCCDF format.

Our Project incorporates software developed since 2012 by the `U.S. Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport (NUWCDIVNPT) <https://www.navsea.navy.mil/Home/Warfare-Centers/NUWC-Newport/>`_. More information, and the software itself, is available on GitHub: `STIG Manager <https://github.com/NUWCDIVNPT/stig-manager/>`_
