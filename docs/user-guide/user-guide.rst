.. note::
      **For the purposes of this report, only Reviews with Not a Finding, Not Applicable, or Open Results are considered "Assessed." Those Reviews that are "Saved" with a Result other than those three do not contribute to the tallies presented here. In order to be Submitted or Accepted, a Review must have one of those 3 Results.**

The components of the Collection Dashboard are described below. 


Collection Overview 
----------------------------

The Collection Overview section at the left of the Collection Dashboard provides high-level statistics about the Collection. 

The Assets and STIGS presented in the Collection Dashboard can be filtered by clicking on the Label icon at the top of the Collection Overview Panel. Only those Assets with at least one of the selected Labels will contribute to the metrics summaries presented in this panel.

      - **Progress Chart** - Presents the proportion of Reviews that have been Assessed out of the total number of Assessments required in a Collection (ie. The total number of Rules contained in all STIGs that have been assigned to all Assets). The number of Assessed Reviews is further broken down by the Status of each of those Reviews. Depending on your process, you may want all your Reviews to wind up with an "Assessed," "Submitted," or "Accepted" status (The "Assessed" proportion here is the number of Reviews that have been "Saved" with :ref:`a valid Assessment Result <assessment note>`).  **The "Import..." button allows users to update their Reviews by importing .ckl(b) or XCCDF checklist files. Imports will NOT create new Assets and STIG assignments when initiated from the Collection Dashboard.**
      - **CORA** - CORA scoring is calculated from a Weighted Average that reflects the number and severity of Open or Unassessed  rules.  The CORA panel displays a count of Open or Unassessed Rules for each Severity Category, the overall Weighted Percentage, and the Risk Rating for the Collection. The Risk Rating is color-coded to indicate the level of risk, with categories ranging from Very Low to Very High. The CORA panel is responsive to the filters applied in the Dashboard. The same scoring is available more granularly in the grid displays of the STIGs, Assets, and Labels tabs. See below for more information about the CORA Score calculation.
      - **Inventory** - Total number of Assets, unique STIGs, and checklists (STIGs assigned to Assets) in this Collection. If you are a Manager or Owner for this Collection, you will see a "Manage" button on the right of this box's header. Click it to open the  :ref:`manage-collection-workspace`.
      - **Findings** - Total number of "Open" Findings in a Collection, broken down by Severity Category. Click the "Details" button on the right of this box's header to open the Findings Report. The Findings Report provides a way to engage with all "Open" findings in a Collection, and generate a precursor POA&M from them. See :ref:`Findings Report` for more info.
      - **Review Ages** - The age of the oldest Review in a Collection and the newest Review in a Collection. Whenever Review *content* (Result or commentary) is modified, its timestamp is updated, and this is used to calculate the ages presented here as "oldest" and "newest." The "Updated" block represents the last time the *Status* of a Review changed (ie. when a Saved, Submitted, Accepted, or Rejected status was applied).
      - **Export Metrics** - Various ways to export the data presented in this report. See below for more details. 

.. note::
      Any filters applied to the Collection Overview panel carry forward to the presentation of STIGs, Assets, and Labels tabs on the right of the Collection Dashboard.

CORA Score Calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Cyber Operational Readiness Assessment (CORA)** evaluates the effectiveness of security controls and operational processes.

**Risk Rating** is calculated from a **Weighted Average** that reflects the number and severity of *open* or *unassessed* rules.
Reviews with *Open*, *Not a Finding*, or *Not Applicable* results are considered *assessed*.
Reviews with other results (such as *Not Reviewed* or *Informational*) are treated as *unassessed*.

Each severity category (CAT I, II, III) is weighted differently when calculating the overall score:

**Weighted Average** formula:

``(p₁·w₁ + p₂·w₂ + p₃·w₃) / (w₁ + w₂ + w₃)``

where:
  - ``pₙ`` = % of open + unassessed rules in that category
  - ``wₙ`` = weight **(CAT I = 10, CAT II = 4, CAT III = 1)**

The **Risk Rating** is primarily determined by the **Weighted Average**, except for the special "Low" risk condition. If a score would be evaluated as "Moderate" but meets the requirements for "Low" risk, it is assigned "Low" risk instead:

- **Very High:** **≥ 20%**
- **High:** **≥ 10% and < 20%**
- **Moderate:** **> 0% and < 10%**
- **Low:** **CAT I = 0; CAT II & III each < 5%** *unweighted*
- **Very Low:** **0% total**


Metrics Export Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This panel provides various ways to export the metrics that STIG Manager maintains about your Collection:

      - Grouped By: - The data presented in this report can be exported using several different grouping options:
            - **Collection** - Will produce an entry with one line, aggregating all metrics data for every Asset/STIG in a Collection together.
            - **Asset** - Will produce one entry per Asset in a Collection, tallying all the metrics data for all STIGs assigned to that Asset.
            - **STIG** - Will produce one entry per unique STIG in a Collection, tallying metrics data for all Assets that are assigned that STIG.
            - **Label** - Will produce one entry per Label in a Collection, tallying the metrics data for each Asset that has been assigned that Label, and all of those Asset's assigned STIGs. *Note:* Because Assets can be assigned more than one Label, individual Assets can contribute to more than one Label entry, and the total Asset count may total more than the number of Assets in a Collection. 
            - **Ungrouped** - Will produce an entry for each STIG assigned to each Asset in the Collection. 
      - Style: - The granularity of the metrics data exported:
            - **Summary** - Presents data fields found to be relevant for the most common use cases.  See the table below for field descriptions. 
            - **Detail** - Very granular data, providing counts for all supported Result values, and subtotals for Reviews that were performed by an automated tool. See the table below for field descriptions. 
      - Format: - Data format of the download: 
            - **CSV** - Comma-Separated Values, suitable for manipulation in a spreadsheet editor.
            - **JSON** - JavaScript Object Notation - Useful for most other, non-spreadsheet, applications.

Collection Checklist Navigation 
---------------------------------------

The right side of the Collection Dashboard provides various ways to navigate the Checklist data maintained by STIG Manager, as well as many useful Metrics. This data can be presented aggregated by Asset, Labels, or STIGs by selecting the appropriate tab. Each panel allows you to drill down to the individual Assets or STIGs in those groupings. Each panel can also be exported individually as a .csv using the down-arrow icon at the bottom of each panel.

Each tab and grid of the Collection Dashboard presents the total number of Checks associated with each Asset or STIG across the Collection, depending on how it was grouped and what filters have been applied.  The grids also list the number of Checks with no Evaluation at all, and Checks that have been Saved, Submitted, Rejected, or Accepted as a way to gauge overall Evaluation progress of the Collection.  The total number of "Open" Severity Category 1, 2, and 3 Rules is also displayed to give an indication of the vulnerability status of the Collection.

This Log tab displays how this Review has changed over time.


Review Panel
----------------------------
The Review panel contains the Evaluation and any required details or commentary for this Review.

Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Evaluation holds the actual Result of a compliance decision about this Rule on the selected Asset, and the required Details and/or Comment. The Results supported are: Open (O), Not a Finding (NF), Not Applicable (NA), Informational (I), and Not Reviewed (NR).  The colored sprites next to the Result provide additional information about the source of the Result. 


Reviews can be set to Saved or Submitted statuses from this interface. "Saved" simply indicates that the review has been logged to the system. The "Submitted" status indicates that the Evaluator considers the review to be "complete"  and may be optionally be "Accepted" or "Rejected" by a User with proper grants in the Collection.

The requirements for a Review to be set to "Submitted" status can be configured in the Collection Management Workspace by Collection Owners and Managers. These requirements will be displayed in this interface if you hover over the ``(?)`` icon next to each field label. 

The default Settings for Reviews in Collections are:
      - Always display the Detail field.
      - Require text in the Detail field in order to Submit. 
      - Display the Comment field for "Findings only".
      - Require text in the Comment field for "Findings only" in order to Submit.
      - Review must have an Evaluation Result of "Not A Finding," "Not Applicable," or "Open. (Not Configurable)

Save, Save/Submit, and Accept Buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The buttons on the bottom of the Review Panel allow the User to simply Save the review for later, to Submit the Review, or to Accept the Review (if they have the proper Collection Grant).  In most use cases, the goal for Evaluators will be to get every Review into a "Submitted" state.  Once Submitted, the Collection Owner can set the Review to "Accepted" to indicate they have ok'd it. The Collection Owner can also Reject the Review with Feedback, which will be marked so that the Reviewer can fix any issue with the commentary, or attempt to Close an Open Finding.

Automated "Result Engine" Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a Review was imported from a source of automated assessments, such as Evaluate STIG or SCC, they may be marked as such in the UI.  The origin of Reviews (Automated, Manual, Override/Answer File) is indicated in the "gear" checklist column, and with colored informational sprites next to the Result in the Review Evaluation Panel. Hover over the sprites for more info.

Clone Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "Clone Collection" button allows Managers or Owners to create another Collection that is a copy of the one they are currently viewing.  
This feature can be useful for creating a "snapshot" of a Collection at a particular point in time that could be used to support certain process or reporting needs. At clone time, the new Collection can be created with all its STIGs "pinned" to the default Revisions of the Source Collection, which will ensure the Clone's reviews and metrics do not change when Reference STIGs are updated.

|

The new Collection can be substantially identical to the original, but must have a different name.

Users can choose to copy the Assets, their STIGs, Labels, and/or Reviews from the original Collection into the new one.  They can also choose to copy the User Grants from the original Collection into the new one, and pin STIG Revisions to their current values. 

.. note::
   Whether or not the User Grants are copied, the User who created the new Collection will be an Owner of the new Collection.

.. warning::
      Large Collections can take several minutes to clone! During this time, Users will likely see a performance impact when accessing the source Collection. Making changes to the source Collection while it is being cloned may lead to inconsistent results in the cloned Collection.
      
      You may want to alert your users before cloning a large Collection.

|


Review Status Per Result:
  This setting allows you to define the desired Review Status—Accepted, Submitted, Saved, or Keep Existing if possible (for existing reviews)—for each result type: Fail, Not Applicable, or Pass.
  
  - **Keep Existing**: Keep the existing Status, if possible. New reviews are set to "Saved" status. The resulting Status will also take into consideration the "Reset to Saved" configuration that is set in the Review Status section of Collection Settings. 
  - **Accepted**: If importing user has the proper grant, set Review to "Accepted." If they cannot Accept, Reviews will be set to "Submitted." If review does not meet Submit requirements, Review will be set to "Saved."
  - **Submitted**: Set Review to "Submitted" status. If review does not meet Submit requirements, Review will be set to Saved.
  - **Saved**:(**default setting**) Set Reviews to "Saved" status.


Include Unreviewed Rules:
  Should Rule Results without a compliance result (NF, NA, O) be imported?

  - **Never**: Ignore these rules. Existing STIG Manager results will not change.  
  - **Having Comments**: (**default setting**) Import these rules only if Detail or Comment is provided. Existing STIG Manager Reviews will be overwritten with the provided Result and Commentary.
  - **Always**: Always import these reviews. Replace any existing Review content.

Unreviewed with a comment is:
  If import includes reviews that do not have a compliance result (NF, NA, O), but includes Detail or Comment information, STIG Manager should import these Reviews with a Result of:

  - **Informational**: (**default setting**) Set Result to "Informational" to distinguish it from those Reviews that have no commentary. 
  - **Not Reviewed**: Leave the result as "Not_Reviewed"


Empty Detail text is:
  If the file includes Reviews with empty Detail text, the Detail text field will be:

  - **Ignored**: (**default setting**) Retain any existing Detail content already stored in STIG Manager. 
  - **Replaced**: Create a generic message indicating the fact that the imported Review had no content here. (This message will become the Detail text for the purposes of meeting submission requirements)
  - **Imported**: This will have the effect of removing any existing Detail text in STIG Manager.

Empty Comment text is:
  If the file includes Reviews with empty Comment text, the Comment text field will be:

  - **Ignored**: (**default setting**) Retain any existing Comment content already stored in STIG Manager. 
  - **Replaced**: Create a generic message indicating the fact that the imported Review had no content here. (This message will become the Comment text for the purposes of meeting submission requirements)
  - **Imported**: This will have the effect of removing any existing Comment text in STIG Manager.

Options can be customized for each import:
  Allow users to customize these import options to suit their needs. The options specified here will always be the initial settings presented to all users for this Collection. (**default: allow**)

Begin by selecting a CSV that contains asset data. Once uploaded, the importer parses each row, validating the entries before proceeding. Only rows with valid data are considered for submission — any invalid rows are automatically ignored for submission with the respective errors on that row shown. During validation, the importer checks for non-existing labels referenced in the CSV and automatically marks them to be created upon submission. After validation completes, the user can submit the data. Submission is only enabled if at least one valid asset is detected.

.. _Collection Builder:

Import CKL or XCCDF files to Build or Update Your Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

STIG Manager lets you populate your entire Collection from scratch or add to an existing Collection with a bulk import of .ckl and XCCDF files. This feature will create any new Assets you submit files for, and assign them the STIGs specified in the imported files.  If the Asset already exists, the newly imported STIGs will be assigned to them. The User can also choose whether or not to import the Reviews in the imported files, or just create the Assets and STIG Assignments.

The Asset Name must match exactly. Check the :term:`ckl` and :term:`XCCDF` glossary entries for how their individual fields map to STIG Manager fields. 

.. note::
   When STIG Manager creates an Asset from an imported file, it will populate the Name, FQDN, IP, and MAC fields if they are present in the file. If the asset is already created, those fields are NOT updated when a file is imported. 


.. note::
   STIG Manager does not retain the .ckl or XCCDF files that are imported. The files are parsed and the Reviews stored in STIG Manager's Database. STIG Manager can produce a new .ckl representation of its Reviews on demand. 

Collection Builder Process
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


From the Collection Management workspace, click the "Import CKL or XCCDF..." button at the top of the Assets panel .

|

If there is an issue with the files you selected, they will appear here. One error you may encounter is that the STIG in the selected file is not installed in STIG Manager. If this is the case, contact a STIG Manager Administrator to have them install it.

If you provide multiple files for the same Asset and STIG, only the latest will be imported. 

This screen will be skipped if there are no issues with the files you have selected.

|

The user is presented with the log of the import. Select an item in the top grid for information about any "rejected" Reviews that were unable to be imported into STIG Manager. This may happen for Rules that are not currently assigned to this Asset, or for versions of STIGs that have not been loaded into STIG Manager.


.. note::
   STIG Manager does not retain the .ckl or XCCDF files that are imported. The files are parsed and the Reviews stored in STIG Manager's Database. STIG Manager can produce a new .ckl representation of its Reviews on demand. 

.. note::
   STIG Manager will import and export .ckl files differently depending on the values of certain .ckl elements and Asset metadata. See :ref:`ckl-processing` for more information.

Export Results to Another Collection
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The user can export results from Assets in the current Collection to another Collection. The user must have "Manage" or "Owner" levels of access in the destination Collection. You will only see Collections that you have sufficient access to in the "Export To" pulldown.
If the destination Collection does not have an Asset of the same name as the one being exported, a new Asset will be created in the destination Collection. If the destination Collection already has an Asset of the same name, any STIGs that are not already assigned to the Asset in the destination Collection will be assigned to it.  Any STIGs that are already assigned to the Asset in the destination Collection will be updated with the new results in accordance with the Collection settings of the destination.

.. note::
      The "Export Results to Another Collection" option is limited to a maximum of 100 Assets at one time.

Set a Default STIG Revision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can "Pin" a specific Revision of a STIG to the Collection. This will lock this Collection to that specific Revision of a STIG, rather than use the default behavior of always using the latest Revision of a STIG. This will affect all calculated Metrics as well as the initial Revision of a STIG presented in all Workspaces. 

To set a specific default Revision of a STIG for a Collection, open the STIG Assignment window with the "Assign STIG" button or double-click on the Revision in the STIGs panel. Select the desired Revision from the "Default revision" dropdown menu, and click "Update."  To revert to the default behavior, select "Most Recent Revision" from the dropdown menu and click "Update."

The Update action may take a moment, as STIG Manager will need to recalculate all metrics based on the new Revision.

The "pinned" Revision is indicated with a pin icon in the STIGs Panel and Collection Dashboard.

.. note::
    A STIG must be assigned to at least one Asset in a Collection in order to be Pinned!

.. _ckl-processing-brief:

A Note on .CKL Processing
=================================

When the STIG Manager Client imports data from :term:`.ckl files <ckl>`, in the simplest case it will attempt to match (and, in some instances, create) the Asset specified in the .ckl's ``<HOST_NAME>`` element.  However, if the ``<ASSET><WEB_OR_DATABASE>`` element in the .ckl has a value of ``true``, special processing is invoked. This processing will attempt to match the ``<HOST_NAME>``, ``<WEB_DB_SITE>`` and ``<WEB_DB_INSTANCE>`` values in the .ckl with Asset metadata when identifying the Asset. 

See the :ref:`ckl-processing` section of this Documentation for more information.
