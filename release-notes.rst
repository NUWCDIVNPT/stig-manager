1.5.11
-------

Changes:

  - (UI) feature: Support for specifying idle timeout values that will cause the web app to discard its tokens, forcing reauthentication, after the specified period of inactivity.
  - (API/UI) feature: Persist user web preferences in the API database rather than browser local storage
  - (UI) feature: Prefix filenames of exported checklists/archives with appropriate U/CUI markings
  - (UI) enhancement: Add "Select All" button to Dashboard Overview Filters, move "Apply" button to the top of filter menu

1.5.10
-------

Changes:

  - (UI) feature: New OIDC SharedWorker implementation for better token management across browser tabs allows STIG Manager to be used in more than one browser tab at once. 
  - (UI) feature: New options for Client reauthentication: popup window (new default), tab, iframe, or traditional redirect (the old behavior). When configured to use any of the first three options, when a session expires, users will be prompted to reauthenticate without losing the current state of their workspace. Control with new envvar: `STIGMAN_CLIENT_REAUTH_ACTION`. 
  - (UI) feature: Added support for opaque refresh tokens to improve compatibility with various OIDC providers
  - (UI) enhancement: Better error handling during app startup
  - (UI) performance: "Other Assets" data now loads only when that tab is opened, improving load times
  - (API) enhancement: Easier handling of disabled Assets and Collections with database views
  - (API) fix: Better handling of reviews posted for disabled Assets and Collections
  - (API) fix: Allow "unavailable" user properties to be set if the request also changes their status to "available" 
  - (UI) enhancement: Updated to stigman-client-modules v1.5.5 for improved duplicate asset name detection and handling
  - (API) Dependencies: Various security updates

  Note 1: This release includes a database migration to support new features.
  Note 2: Some OIDC providers do not properly advertise their support of the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE in their configuration metadata. If you experience issues with OIDC authentication, you may need to set the environment variable `STIGMAN_CLIENT_STRICT_PKCE =false` to disable the strict PKCE check by the STIG Manager client. STIG Manager Client will still use PKCE for the OIDC flow, but will not require the OIDC provider to advertise its support for PKCE in its metadata. 

1.5.9
-------

  - (API/OAS) feature: Added endpoint to support the creation of multiple Assets in a Collection
  - (API/OAS) feature: Created state module to consolidate API process flow, exit, and dependency retries; endpoint to report API state.
  - (API) feature: Changes to support detection and response to database outage conditions; integrated with state module
  - (API) feature: Added behavior that prevents bootstrap when OIDC provider is using insecure key Ids, and rejects requests made with tokens signed by such keys.
  - (Workflows) Only generate coverage report from end-to-end API tests
  - (Docs) Updated to describe envvars that should only be changed in Dev/Test environments.
  - (API/Docs) Dependency Updates

**NOTE:** 
  This release changes the behavior of the API when configured to use an OIDC provider that presents realm keys identified by Key Ids used in this project's automated testing.  The API will no longer start if the initial realm keys specified by the OIDC Provider are identified by the same Key Ids used in our testing, and if started, will reject all requests that present a token signed by these keys.

  This condition may occur if your deployment is using a Keycloak container based on one of our Demo containers without making additional changes. If STIGMan refuses to start and outputs a log indicating "insecure_kid - JWKS contains insecure key IDs", you should update your realm's signing keys immediately. To change the signing keys used by Keycloak, check [their documentation on generating realm keys](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#realm_keys).

The new Grant system also allows for "Read Only" access to Collection Reviews. Details of the new Role-Based Access Control system are found in the [STIG Manager documentation](https://stig-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/roles-and-access.html).
  - (API/UI/DB) [New User Groups feature.](https://stig-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin-guide/admin-guide.html#user-groups-admin-panel)
  - (UI) The Collection Review Workspace has been reworked to give more room to Checklist statistics columns and enable future expansion. The display should now be significantly less constrained, especially when viewing extra columns that are usually hidden by default.

  - This release changes the minimum required MySQL version from 8.0.21 => 8.0.24
  - This migration will convert any existing "Asset-STIG" style assignments for Restricted Users to the equivalent Access Control List style Grants under the new system. After migration, you may want to remove the granular Access Control Rules and create new ones with the more flexible system (for example, creating one Access Control Rule granting access to an entire Asset, rather than each individual Asset-STIG).
  - **This release introduces "breaking" changes to the API and STIG Manager OpenAPI definition.** If you have custom integrations or clients that rely on the STIG Manager API, you may need to update them to accommodate these changes. Check the [rbac v2 implementation Pull Request](https://github.com/NUWCDIVNPT/stig-manager/pull/1487) for details of the changes to the API with this release.
