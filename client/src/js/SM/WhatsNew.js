      <p>
 <b>Cyber Operational Readiness Assessment (CORA)</b>-style scoring is now available in the Collection and Meta Dashboards. 
 CORA scoring treats Unassessed rules as if they were Open, and uses a weighted average to calculate the overall risk rating for a Collection, or portion thereof.
       <p>

 The dashboard panel displays a count of Open or Unassessed Rules for each Severity Category, the overall Weighted Percentage, and the Risk Rating for the Collection. The Risk Rating is color-coded to indicate the level of risk, with categories ranging from Very Low to Very High. The CORA panel is responsive to the filters applied in the Dashboard.
 
  <p><img src="img/whatsnew/2025-06-02-cora-score-panel.png" width=350/></p>

  The same scoring is available more granularly in the grid displays of the STIGs, Assets, and Labels tabs:

  <p><img src="img/whatsnew/2025-06-02-cora-score-columns.png" width=750/></p>

<br>
 Reviews with <i>Open</i>, <i>Not a Finding</i>, or <i>Not Applicable</i> results are considered <i>assessed</i>.<br>
 Reviews with other results (such as <i>Not Reviewed</i> or <i>Informational</i>) are treated as <i>unassessed</i>.
 <br><br>
  Each severity category (CAT I, II, III) is weighted differently when calculating the overall score:
  <br>
  <b>Weighted Average</b> formula:<br>
  <code>(p₁·w₁ + p₂·w₂ + p₃·w₃) / (w₁ + w₂ + w₃)</code><br>
  where:<br>
  - <code>pₙ</code> = % of open + unassessed rules in that category<br>
  - <code>wₙ</code> = weight <b>(CAT I = 10, CAT II = 4, CAT III = 1)</b><br><br>
  The <b>Risk Rating</b> is primarily determined by the <b>Weighted Average</b>, except for the special "Low" risk condition:<br>
  <ul style="padding-left: 16px; margin: 4px 0;">
    <li><span class="sm-cora-tooltip-label sm-cora-risk-very-high"><b>Very High</b></span><b> ≥ 20%</b></li>

      Collection Owners and Managers can now configure collection import options more granularly by specifying the desired Review Status for each result type—Fail, Not Applicable, and Pass. If you are using STIGMan Watcher, we recommend updating to <a href="https://github.com/NUWCDIVNPT/stigman-watcher/releases/tag/1.5.2">version 1.5.2</a> to take advantage of this feature for your automated imports as well.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fail</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Not Applicable</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Pass</strong></li>

    body: `
    <p>Collection Owners and Managers can now create Assets in bulk by importing a CSV file. This feature supports all properties of an Asset, including Labels, Metadata, and STIG assignments. New Labels, if needed, will be created on import.</p>

    <p>To import an Assets CSV, click the "Import Assets CSV" button, and select a file. You will be presented with the Assets and Labels to be created, as well as any rows that could not be processed (for example, due to duplicate Asset names or unknown STIGs). Click "Submit" to create all valid Assets/Labels found in the CSV, or "Cancel" if you would prefer to fix any errors in the file and try again.</p>

    <p>To generate a CSV file representation of the Assets in your Collection, click the "Export Assets CSV" button in the Collection Management workspace. If Assets are selected, this will create a CSV file representation of all of the selected Assets, including their Labels and STIG assignments. If no Assets are selected, all Assets will be included in the CSV.</p>

    <p>For the required CSV format, <a target="_blank" href="docs/user-guide/user-guide.html#create-asset-batch">refer to our documentation for detailed field requirements,</a> or click the "Export Assets CSV" button and modify its contents.</p>

Setting a User to "Unavailable" will prevent them from accessing the system, remove any of their existing Collection Grant or User Group assignments, and prevent them from being assigned new ones.</p>
    <p>By default, the "Users" Application Management interface applies a filter on the new Status column to hide "Unavailable" Users. To set a User's status back to "Available", disable the filter, select an "Unavailable" User, and click the "Set Available" button in the toolbar.</p>

    header: `New Dynamic User Grants and User Groups Features`,
    body: `
    <p>The Collection Grants system has been significantly reworked to allow for more dynamic and flexible User Grant management. These new Grants also allow for restriction of Users to "Read Only" or "Read/Write" access to Collection Reviews.</p>
    <p>In addition, Application Managers can now create User Groups. User Groups can be assigned Grants to Collections in the same manner as individual Users, to provide the same level of access to all Users in the group.</p>

    <p> Access Control for these grants can be defined by creating multiple Access Control Rules with any combination of Collection, STIG, Label, or Asset properties, which will combine to granularly control a User's access to Collection Reviews.</p>
    <p>For example, if two Access Control Rules are defined to allow a User to "Read Only" Reviews for a "Databases" label, and "Read/Write" for a the "Databases" label and the "PostgreSQL_9-x_STIG" STIG, the user will be able to view all Reviews for Assets labeled with "Databases" but will only be able to modify Reviews in the "PostgreSQL_9-x_STIG".</p>

    <p>Please see the <a target="_blank" href="docs/user-guide/roles-and-access.html">STIG Manager Documentation for more details about these new Features!</a>.</p>

    <p><img src="img/whatsnew/2025-01-21-collection-manage-acl-popup.png" width=750/></p>

    <p><b>NOTE:</b> All existing "Restricted" Grant types have been migrated with equivalent granular Access Control Rules granting R/W access to those specific Assets and STIGs. If appropriate, you may want to remove these individual Rules and create an ACL granting R/W access to the entire Asset. This will allow the user access to new STIGs that are assigned to that Asset in the future.  </p>
