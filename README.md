# STIG Manager

STIG Manager is an API and Web client for managing the assessment of Information Systems for compliance with [security checklists](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/) published by the United States (U.S.) Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). STIG Manager supports DISA checklists [distributed](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/) as either a Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) or a Security Requirements Guide (SRG).

For many deployments, our official [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nuwcdivnpt/stig-manager) is a good choice.
